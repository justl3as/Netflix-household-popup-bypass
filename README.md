# Netflix Household Popup Bypass

## Introduction

Netflix Household Popup Bypass is a userscript designed to automatically bypass the annoying **"This Device is not part of your Netflix household"** verification popup. This script helps maintain seamless streaming experiences by preventing interruptions from household verification prompts.

The script works by detecting and automatically dismissing the popup when it appears, allowing you to continue watching content without manual intervention. This is particularly useful for users who access Netflix from various locations or share accounts with family members in different households.
